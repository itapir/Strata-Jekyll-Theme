<img src="/images/fulls/01.jpg" class="fit image"> A fairly quick and accurate Pokemon Go Map specifically for WPI area. 

The scan rate is 5mins per loop. Considering that one monster lasts for 15mins so you always have at least 10 minutes to catch it.

If the server is not available that means either I turned off my computer or Niantic have something to speak for their game.

This server is based on AHAAAAAAA's github project <a href="https://github.com/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map">PokemonGo-Map</a>.




Entrance: <a href="http://68.187.213.19:4000/">http://68.187.213.19:4000/</a>

Attention: DO NOT CHANGE THE LOCATION OR ANY OTHER SETTINGS!
